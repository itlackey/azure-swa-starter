# Static Site with Python Function Starter
This starter kit uses Svelte and Eleventy to build the static site frontend. It also includes a basic example 
of using JavaScript Managed Functions as a backend. 

## Tools
To use the pre-configured npm scripts, you will need to install the Azure Static Website CLI tool globally.

### Installing CLI tools

```bash
npm i -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli
```

## Running locally

* `npm start` - local server using swa CLI
* `npm run debug` - swa cli will wait for you to launch the 'Debug Functions' session in VSCode
* `npm run watch` - runs rollup and eleventy with watch flags
* `npm run 11ty` - runs rollup and eleventy with serve flags
* `npm run build` - runs rollup and eleventy build steps
* `npm run clean` - deletes .dist
